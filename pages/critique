Alternatively the critiquing sample could be two options, and you ask students to select the better alternative or, if needed, to build a third model. This is an opportunity for students to evaluate their own proficiency at probing the details of a model, find problems, and define appropriate solutions. Because they are not starting from scratch, it provides an easier route into complex problems. The model could be a <text>[[Fixer Upper]]</text> or <text>[[Larger Than Life]]</text>.",

You should not underestimate the amount of time needed to build the examples. Occasionally, after critiquing the first model, some of the students express a preference for critiquing in a team setting; you might want to use <text>[[Student Design Sprint]]</text> for setting up teams. Those students can then critique in pairs or small teams, while allowing those students who would prefer to perform the critique on their own to work alone. The activity can be customized to the students' specific business domain. This requires pre-delivery definition of the business area by the client and the instructor, to control scope.",
